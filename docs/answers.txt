E. 1. Branches are helpful if you make a mistake you are wokring on a "backup" and you don't lose all your original work. You can push updates once they are complete and tested 100%. 
   2. Branches are also very helpful when working in a team setting because things would get messy fast if multipule people were editing the same files at the same time. Everyone working on their own branch solves this issue. 


F. The git log command shows a list of previous commits while the git status command shows changes made since the last commit. 


G. "git log -- Weapon.h"


H. "git log -- grep="file""


I. 1. Inheritance is when gets its properties from another class. (like parent/child classes)
   2. Polymorphism is when a child class overloads one of its parents functions to work in a different manner for its specific needs.  
   3. Encapsulaton is when code is written in a way that the user is on a "need-to-know" basis and cannot access any more of the data than they need. This includes using Public, Private, and Protected access modifiers.
